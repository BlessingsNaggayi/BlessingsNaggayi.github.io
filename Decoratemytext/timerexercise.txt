setTimeout(booyah,2000);

booyah is a call back here.It sets a timer of 2 seconds and calls the function after 2 seconds

setTimeout(booyah(),2000)

This calls the booyah "function" and then passes the return value of that function to the setTimeout method


alert(x) = 3

alert(y(2,3)) =6


let timeoutId1 = setTimeout(booyah,2000);

let timeoutId2 = setTimeout(booyah2(),2000);

 


function booyah1(){

  alert("BOOYAH!");

}

function booyah2(){

  alert("BOOYAH!");

}



Unobtrusive Javascript 

This is code written where the HTML file has very minimal JavaScript.
The DOM is used to attach and execute all Javascript functions.


Why use unobtrusive JavaScript?

allows separation of website into 3 major categories
content(HTML),presentation(CSS),behaviour(JavaScript)
